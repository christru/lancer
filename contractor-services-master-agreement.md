2. **Contracted Services. **This Agreement shall apply to the delivery of information technology services, support, and functions as further described in Statements of Work (SOW) that may be proposed and approved by the parties. Any such approved SOW shall be incorporated herein by reference (the services and functions described in any SOW are hereafter referred to as the "Services").

Absent the execution of a SOW, this Agreement does not, in and of itself, represent a commitment by Client to receive any Services from Contractor or pay Contractor any fees.

3. **Term of Agreement**

    9. The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date set forth above and will continue until terminated by either party as provided below ("Term"). In the event that the SOW provides for a different Term, the SOW Term will control for that specific SOW only.

    10. Either party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement, without cause, by providing sixty (60) days notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement without cause. In the event that a SOW provides for a different termination notice period, the SOW termination clause will control for that specific SOW only.

    11. In the event that there is a continuing need for any Services identified in a SOW, after the expiration of this Agreement and Client requests, in writing, to have Contractor complete the Services, this Agreement will automatically renew for the period of time that it takes for the completion of such Services.

    12. The Agreement can be terminated for cause, as defined in paragraph 14(a) herein, at any time provided the alleged breaching party is provided an opportunity to cure the alleged breach in the manner set forth in paragraph 14(a) below or a Permitted Delay, as defined in paragraph 14(d) herein, does not apply.

4. **Fees and Payment Terms**

    13. In exchange for the Services performed by Contractor, as set forth in any SOW, Client agrees to compensate Contractor at the rates identified in the fee schedule set forth in a SOW. Such rates are exclusive of any federal, state, or local sales or use taxes, or any other taxes or fees assessed on, or in connection with any of the Services rendered herein. Client will pay all undisputed invoices within fourteen (14) days of receipt thereof.

    14. In addition, Client shall reimburse Contractor his actual out-of-pocket expenses as reasonably incurred by Contractor in connection with the performance of Services. Additional expenses for materials, services, training and hardware may only be incurred by Contractor and charged to Client if prior written approval from Client has been obtained.

    15. Late charges shall be made pursuant of the relevant SOW. In the case where late charges are not specified in the SOW, a late charge of five percent (5%) per month, or the legal maximum if less, shall accrue on past due billings unless Client notifies Contractor of a billing dispute in writing prior to the payment due date. Payments will be credited to late payments first, then to unpaid balances. Client shall be responsible for any costs incurred by Contractor in the collection of unpaid invoices including, but not limited to, collection and filing costs and reasonable attorney’s fees of not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding balance due. Contractor may withhold delivery and transfer of ownership of any current work if accounts are not current or overdue invoices are not paid in full.

5. **Change Orders or Out of Scope Services.**

    16. To the extent that Client requires or requests additional services or services that exceed the Services set forth in any SOW incorporated herein, Contractor will charge an additional fee for such additional services or out of scope work. Fees for such additional services or out of scope work will be set forth on a Change Authorization Order (CAO), which will also provide a description of the changed or additional service(s) being requested. Once a CAO is signed by both parties, it will be incorporated into the Agreement and have the same legal effect as the SOW that is incorporated into the Agreement.

    17. Within seven (7) business days of receiving a request for CAO, Contractor will respond with a CAO proposing availability, additional fees, changes to delivery dates, and any modification to the Agreement. Contractor will evaluate each CAO at its standard rate and charges.

    18. Client will have seven (7) days to respond in writing accepting or rejecting the new CAO. If Client rejects the proposal, Contractor will not be obligated to perform any services beyond those in the original Agreement.

6. **Ownership of Materials Related to Services.**

    19. The parties agree that all rights and ownership of materials related to Services belongs to Contractor prior to full and final payment. Upon payment in full, all rights, title, and interests of such materials shall be and are assigned to Client as its sole and exclusive property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties recognize that performance of Contractor hereunder will require the skills of Contractor and, therefore, Contractor shall retain the right to use, without fee and for any purpose, such "know-how", ideas, techniques and concepts used or developed by Contractor in the course of performance of the services of this Agreement.

    20. Contractor retains the right to reproduce, publish and display the Deliverables in Contractor’s portfolios and websites, in galleries, design periodicals and other media or exhibits for the purposes of recognition of creative excellence or professional advancement, and to be credited with authorship of the Deliverables in connection with such uses.

    25. At the request of either party ("Requester"), the other party shall return all Confidential Information received from the Requester, back to the Requester, and shall not retain any copies of, or other reproductions or extracts of, the Confidential Information, except as it may retain in accordance with prudent business practices (any retained material shall remain subject to the provisions of this Agreement without any time limit).
